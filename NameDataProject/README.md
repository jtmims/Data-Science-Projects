# NameDataProject
A really simple school project in which we were given various data files. Not the most up-to-industry form of data science, but I thought it was quite enjoyable. I was in quite the time crunch for this project. I may redo it in python. Email me if you'd like to have the files!

Each file was designated for each state and included:

-Name

-Gender

-Year

-Amount of people named that specific name in that year
